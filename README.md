# The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-ICOs-and-Crypto-Economic-Token-Models
The Past, Present and Future of ICOs and Crypto-Economic Token Models

This talk will be two parts.

## Part I
We will run through the history of different token economic models and discuss new price discovery auction models for ICOs using Mathematics, Game Theory and Economics. 

We will also briefly discuss regulatory landscape and how different countries regulators are debating the balance between the existing and new regulations for investor protections from the crypto currencies, tokens, and crypto exchanges.

## Part II
This will be a practical demo. 

We will design and deploy a price discovery token model using Uniform Dutch Auction with some time dependent game theoretic benefits.
